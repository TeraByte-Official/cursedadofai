## Main Game

### {1-X} - A Dance of Fire and Ice but it's excruciatingly long
Every 270° tile has a 2-beat pause.

### {2-X} - Offbeats but the vertical sections are very short
All vertical straight tiles are removed.

### {3-X} - THE WIND-UP but it's very wound up
Inferior-angled tiles are changed to be halfway between their original angle and 0°.
Reflex-angled tiles; ditto, but with 360°.
Straight tiles are unchanged.

### {4-X} - Love Letters but they're actually hate letters
Twirls are placed and removed such that all angles are inferior, switching to reflex and back after every segment of straight tiles.

### {5-X} - The Midnight Train but it's going the wrong way
Angled tiles are reflected along the vertical axis.
Not in the repository (yet).

### {6-X} - PULSE but it was designed strangely
The chart is moved one tile backwards, and speed changes are added to undo this effect.
Not in the repository (yet).

### {7-X} - Spin 2 Win but there are no icons
All holds, twirls, and speed changes are removed (unless they were already hidden.)

### {8-X} - Jungle City but there's no repeat tiles
Any tiles that have the same angle as the previous tile are removed.

### {9-X} - Classic Pursuit but it's double time
Speed is doubled, and all tiles have another tile with the same angle appended after it.

### {10-X} - Butterfly Planet but...?
Not made (yet).

### {11-X} - Heracles but...?
Not made (yet).

### {12-X} - Artificial Chariot but...?
Not made (yet).
